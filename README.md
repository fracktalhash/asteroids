## **Overview**
This project recreates the classic arcade game **Asteroids** using Python and the Pygame library. It is designed as a hands-on learning experience for working with multi-file Python projects, implementing object-oriented programming, and utilizing a popular game development library.

---

## **Features**
- Fully functional 2D space shooter inspired by **Asteroids**.
- Object physics and collisions.
- Smooth animations and simple sound effects.
- Modular, object-oriented codebase for scalability.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pygame**: For handling game graphics, input, and audio.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: For clean and modular code structure.
